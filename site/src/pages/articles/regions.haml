  h3. Regions
  
  Ojay comes with a class called @Ojay.Region@, which is a "decorator":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern
  for the "@YAHOO.util.Region@":http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/docs/YAHOO.util.Region.html class.
  It is used to represent the area occupied by an element on a web page. All region objects
  have four properties: @top@, @bottom@, @left@ and @right@, which specify the edges of the
  rectangle containing the element, measured in pixels. All dimensions returned by region
  objects are in pixels.

  h3. Region API
  
  @Region@ objects are returned by the @Ojay('#myElement').getRegion()@ method. Region objects
  have the following methods:
  
  * @getWidth()@ - returns the width of the region
  * @getHeight()@ - returns the height of the region
  * @getDiagonal()@ - returns the diagonal length of the region
  * @getArea()@ - returns the area of the region in square pixels
  * @getCenter()@ - returns an object with @left@ and @top@ properties describing the center of the region.
  * @contains(region)@ - returns @true@ iff the receiver completely contains @region@.
  * @intersects(region)@ - returns @true@ iff the receiver overlaps @region@.
  * @intersection(region)@ - returns the region occupied by both the receiver and @region@.
  * @union(region)@ - returns the region that just contains both the receiver and @region@.
