  h3. Sequencing
  
  Sequencing is the process of setting some action to be carried out on the members of an
  array. You can then step through the array, carrying out the action on each member in
  turn.

  For example, let's say you want to rotate the source of some image on your page. You have
  a list of images:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">    var sources = [
          'header-1.jpg', 'header-2.jpg',
          'some-other-file.jpg', 'ad-banners.jpg'
      ];</pre>
  
  and an action that can be applied to an item in the list to change the source of your
  image:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">    function(source) {
          Ojay('#my-image').set({src: source});
      }</pre>
  
  You create a sequence to perform this action like so:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">    var seq = sources.sequence(function(source) {
          Ojay('#my-image').set({src: source});
      });</pre>
  
  You can then tell the sequence to loop, pausing by some number of seconds between each
  member:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">    seq.loop(10);</pre>
  
  You can tell the loop to pause whenever you like:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">    seq.pause();</pre>
  
  or you can tell it to pause when it next reaches the end of the list:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">    seq.finish();</pre>
  
  You can start the loop again by calling @seq.loop()@.
