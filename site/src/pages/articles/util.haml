  h3. Utility methods
  
  Ojay has a handful of utility functions that don't really fit into any of its specific
  modules and are available through the @Ojay@ namespace.
  
  h3. Required files
  
  * @http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.7.0/build/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js@
  * @http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.7.0/build/selector/selector-beta.js@

  h3. Available methods
  
  * @Ojay.byId(id)@ - can be used to grab an Ojay collection by ID in situations where your
    page contains IDs that will trip up the CSS interpreter. For example:
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">    var myElement = Ojay.byId('site:model.user.email');</pre>
  
  * @Ojay.getDocumentSize()@ - returns an object with @width@ and @height@ properties
    representing the size of the document.
  
  * @Ojay.getScrollOffsets()@ - returns an object with @left@ and @top@ properties that
    represent the current scroll state of the page.
  
  * @Ojay.getViewportSize()@ - returns an object with @width@ and @height@ properties
    representing the size of the visible area of the document within the window.
