  h3. The structure of Ojay
  
  Ojay is packaged as a series of JavaScript files that provide different modules of the library.
  When you download Ojay, you'll be presented with the following folder structure:
  
  <ul>
    <li>@js-class.js@</li>
    <li>@core.js@</li>
    <li>@all.js@</li>
    <li>@/pkg@
      <ul>
        <li>@accordion.js@</li>
        <li>@forms.js@</li>
        <li>@history.js@</li>
        <li>@http.js@</li>
        <li>@keyboard.js@</li>
        <li>@mouse.js@</li>
        <li>@overlay.js@</li>
        <li>@paginator.js@</li>
        <li>@tabs.js@</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  Let's go through each item:
  
  h3. @js-class.js@
  
  This file is a distribution of a subset of James Coglan's @JS.Class@ library, which provides a
  Ruby-like object orientation framework for JavaScript. This distribution includes @Class@, @Module@,
  @Singleton@, @Interface@, @MethodChain@, @Observable@ and @State@. More information on this library
  can be found via "its website":http://jsclass.jcoglan.com
  
  The file @js-class.js@ is required by the Ojay core, and must be included before it on your web pages.
  
  h3. @pkg@
  
  The @pkg@ directory contains 'packages' - add-ons to the Ojay core that provide specialised pieces
  of functionality. These currently include:
  
  * @accordion.js@ - Accordion menu widgets
  * @forms.js@ - Provides for easy styling and validation of form inputs
  * @history.js@ - A wrapper for @YAHOO.util.History@ for back button management
  * @http.js@ - A wrapper for @YAHOO.util.Connect@ for Ajax
  * @keyboard.js@ - Allows easy management of responses to keyboard input
  * @mouse.js@ - Tracks mouse movements and provides @mouseenter@/@mouseleave@ events
  * @overlay.js@ - A simple library for overlaying content on top of the document
  * @paginator.js@ - Implements classes for scrolling and lazy-loading paged content
  * @tabs.js@ - History-manageable tabbed interfaces
  
  h3. @core@
  
  @core.js@ contains the Ojay core libraries. These provide DOM manipulation, event management,
  animation, and some extensions to JavaScript's @Array@, @String@ and @Function@ classes.
  
  @all.js@ includes everything in the download in a single file. It's a little large, but you can
  use it if you don't want to worry about dependencies.
  
  h3. A typical page setup
  
  Here's a list of files you'd typically include in your page to get Ojay running:
  
  * @http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.8.0r4/build/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js@
  * @http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.8.0r4/build/selector/selector.js@
  * @http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.8.0r4/build/animation/animation.js@
  * @http://yoursite.com/ojay/js-class.js@
  * @http://yoursite.com/ojay/core.js@
  
  If you're using Ajax, include these:
  
  * @http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.8.0r4/build/connection/connection.js@
  * @http://yoursite.com/ojay/pkg/http.js@
  
  If you need back-button management, include these:
  
  * @http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.8.0r4/build/history/history.js@
  * @http://yoursite.com/ojay/pkg/history.js@
